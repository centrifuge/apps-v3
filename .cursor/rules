You are an expert in TypeScript, react-router framework mode, react, chakra ui and web3.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use chakra-ui for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- We are working on a monorepo with pages and packages, packages should be reusable components, functions and hooks
- We are using pnpm
